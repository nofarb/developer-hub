You can define a CI build infrastructure on any Linux or MacOS host. This is the simplest build infrastructure to set up, and is well-suited for developers who want to run builds on a local host such as a laptop.

### Important Notes

* The Docker Delegate has the following system requirements:
	+ Default 0.5 CPU.
	+ Default 1.5GB. Ensure that you provide the minimum memory for the Delegate and enough memory for the host/node system.
* You need to download and install a Drone runner in addition to the delegate.
* The Docker delegate is bound by the total amount of memory and CPU on the local host. If you run multiple builds and the host runs out of CPU or memory, some builds will time out and fail.

### Install the Delegate

1. in the Harness UI, go to the screen that corresponds to the scope of your delegate: **Account Settings,** **Account Settings > Organizations**, or **Project Setup**.
2. Click **New Delegate**, then select **Docker** for the delegate type and click **Continue**.
3. Enter a delegate name and click **Continue**.
4. Download the **docker-compose.yml** file that appears.
5. Click **Continue**.   
The UI shows the delegate as not connected. This is expected behavior. You need to complete this workflow to establish connectivity between the delegate and your instance.
6. Update the **docker-compose.yml** file you just downloaded as follows:
	1. For `DELEGATE TAGS=`, specify one of the following: `macos-amd64` | `windows-amd64` | `linux-amd64`
	2. *MacOS only —* Add this setting to the `environment` list:  
	`- RUNNER_URL=`[`http://host.docker.internal:3000`](http://host.docker.internal:3000/)
	3. *Linux only —* Add the following line immediately after `restart: unless-stopped"`:  
	`network_mode: "host"`
7. To start the delegate, cd to the folder where you downloaded the docker-compose file and then enter:  
 `docker-compose -f <`*`updated-docker-compose.yml`*`> up -d`
8. Download a Drone Runner executable from <https://github.com/harness/drone-docker-runner/releases> .
9. Enable execution permissions for the Runner. For example, on MacOS you can run the command `sudo` `chmod +x` `drone-docker-runner-darwin-amd64`.
10. Start the runner binary:
	1. On MacOS, run `./drone-docker-runner-darwin-amd64 server`
	2. On Linux, run as sudo: `sudo ./drone-docker-runner-darwin-amd64 server`
11. Go back to the Delegates page where you created the new delegate. The delegate should appear as connected. This might take a few minutes.

### Update the Pipeline

Update the pipeline where you want to use the Docker delegate:

1. Switch to the YAML view.
2. Replace the `stages : stage : spec : infrastructure` section for the Build stage as follows.
  :::note 
	This step is critical and is only possible in the YAML editor. You cannot do this step in the UI.
	:::
	1. For the `os:` field, specify `Linux` | `MacOS` | `Windows`.
	2. For the `arch:` field, specify `Amd64`.

#### `infrastructure` Field (*before*)


```
- stage:  
        ...  
        spec:  
          ...  
          infrastructure:  
            ...  

```
#### `platform` and `runtime` Fields (*after, Linux example*)


```
- stage:  
        ...  
        spec:  
          ...  
          platform:  
            os: Linux  
            arch: Amd64  
          runtime:  
            type: Docker  
            spec: {}  
           ...  

```
### Troubleshooting

The delegate should connect to your instance after you finish the install workflow above. 

If the delegate does not connect after a few minutes, run the following commands to check the status:

* `docker ps`
* `docker logs --follow <`*`docker-delegate-container-id`*`>`

The container id should be the one with image name `harness/delegate:latest`. 

If you see a message like the following, the setup should be successful:

* `Finished downloading delegate jar version 1.0.77221-000 in 168 seconds`

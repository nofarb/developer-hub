This topic provides settings for the Upload Artifacts to GCS step, which uploads artifacts to Google Cloud Storage. See [Uploads and downloads](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uploads-downloads) in the Google Cloud docs.

### Name

The unique name for this Connector.

### ID

See [Entity Identifier Reference](../../platform/20_References/entity-identifier-reference.md).

### GCP Connector

The Harness Connector for the GCP account where you want to upload the artifact. See [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Connector Settings Reference](../../platform/7_Connectors/ref-cloud-providers/gcs-connector-settings-reference.md).

### Bucket

GCS destination bucket name.

### Source Path

Path to the artifact file/folder you want to upload. You can use regex to upload multiple files. Harness creates the compressed file automatically.

### Optional Configurations

#### Target

The name of the artifact file.

#### Run as User

Set the value to specify the user id for all processes in the pod, running in containers. See [Set the security context for a pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod).

#### Set container resources

Maximum resources limit values for the resources used by the container at runtime.

##### Limit Memory

Maximum memory that the container can use. You can express memory as a plain integer or as a fixed-point number using the suffixes `G` or `M`. You can also use the power-of-two equivalents `Gi` and `Mi`.

##### Limit CPU

The maximum number of cores that the container can use. CPU limits are measured in cpu units. Fractional requests are allowed: you can specify one hundred millicpu as `0.1` or `100m`. See [Resource units in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes).

##### Timeout

Timeout for the step. Once the timeout is reached, the step fails, and the Pipeline execution continues.ACL

The public Harness CI images on DockerHub needed for CI Pipelines are pulled automatically when you run your Harness Pipeline. You can find them at `https://hub.docker.com/u/harness`.

If you do not want the Harness Delegate to pull images from a public repo for security reasons, you can add a special Harness Connector to your Harness account, and the Delegate will pull these images from the **Harness Container Image Registry** only.

For steps on setting this up, see [Connect to Harness Container Image Registry Using Docker Connector](../../platform/7_Connectors/connect-to-harness-container-image-registry-using-docker-connector.md). 

To help you obtain the required Harness CI images, they are listed in this topic.

### Viewing the CI Images List

You can view the list of images using the following command:

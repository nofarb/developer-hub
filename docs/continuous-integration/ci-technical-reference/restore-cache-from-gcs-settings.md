This topic provides settings for the Restore Cache from GCS step, which restores files and directories that were saved using the [Save Cache to GCS](save-cache-to-gcs-step-settings.md) step.

### Name

The unique name for this step.

### Id

See [Entity Identifier Reference](../../platform/20_References/entity-identifier-reference.md).

### GCP Connector

The Harness Connector for the GCP account where you saved the cache.

### Bucket

GCS bucket name.

### Key

The key used to identify the cache.

The backslash character isn't allowed as part of the checksum added here. This is a limitation of the Go language (golang) template. Use a forward slash instead. 

* Incorrect format: `cache-{{ checksum ".\src\common\myproj.csproj" }`
* Correct format: `cache-{{ checksum "./src/common/myproj.csproj" }}`

### Optional Configurations

#### Archive Format

Select the archive format.

The default archive format is Tar.

#### Fail if Key Doesn't Exist

Select this option to fail the step if the key doesn’t exist.

By default, the Fail if Key Doesn't Exist option is set to False.

#### Run as User

Set the value to specify the user id for all processes in the pod, running in containers. See [Set the security context for a pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod).

#### Set Container Resources

Maximum resources limit values for the resources used by the container at runtime.

##### Limit Memory

Maximum memory that the container can use. You can express memory as a plain integer or as a fixed-point number using the suffixes `G` or `M`. You can also use the power-of-two equivalents `Gi` and `Mi`.

##### Limit CPU

The maximum number of cores that the container can use. CPU limits are measured in cpu units. Fractional requests are allowed: you can specify one hundred millicpu as `0.1` or `100m`. See [Resource units in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes).

##### Timeout

Timeout for the step. Once the timeout is reached, the step fails and the Pipeline execution continues.

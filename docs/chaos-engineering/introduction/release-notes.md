# December 2, 2022, version 0.4.2

## Whatâ€™s new

* Provision to update chaos hub details (Chaos-699)
	* You can update the details (such as name, Git connector, repository name, and branch name) of a connected chaos hub.  

* CDN support for static artifacts (Chaos-600)
	* This release adds CDN support for static artifacts. CDN support reduces the latency while loading the user interface on client devices.

* Version information for Chaos Driver and Chaos Manager (Chaos-729)
	* This release adds version numbers to Chaos Driver and Chaos Manager. Versioning the Chaos Driver and Chaos Manager enables Harness to version the corresponding endpoints (/chaos/driver/api/version for ChaosDriver and /chaos/manager/api/version for ChaosManager).

* Range filter for Experiment Runs in the Experiment overview (Chaos-824)
	* This release adds a range filter option in the Experiment Runs bar graph under Experiment overview that allows setting the range on the last run in the graph.

* Support for fault statuses (Chaos-826)
	* This release adds support to show all the fault statuses in the Experiment Runs graph. In addition to `the Failed` and `Passed` fault status, faults in the `Awaited`, `Stopped`, and `N/A` states are also seen. 

* Seamless upgrade 
	* This release adds a manifest download button for the chaos infrastructures, to enable a seamless upgrade.

* Loaders for components and screens (Chaos-822)
	* This release adds consistent loaders for all the components and screens in the user interface. These loaders decouple API requests and avoid blocking the rendering of the entire page due to chained API calls.

* Configurable response timeout for HTTP probes
	* This release adds a new response timeout parameter for HTTP probes in the user interface. The response timeout is in units of seconds. You can use this parameter to specify timeouts during HTTP probe health checks during chaos fault execution.

## Early access

* There are no early access features in this release. 

## Fixed Issues

* Enterprise ChaosHub appeared in the search results irrespective of the terms searched.

* Details of a previously connected chaos infrastructure are not prefilled when connecting to a new chaos infrastructure. (Chaos-777)

* The Run button was activated even when the chaos experiment was running. Now, the button is reactivated only after the chaos experiment is complete. (Chaos-807)

* The chaos access page shows all experiments and experiment runs instead of showing experiments that were performed within a specific time frame. (Chaos-810, Chaos-762) 

* A cancel button and a back button have been added to the enable chaos screen. The buttons make it easy to navigate between screens while setting up chaos infrastructure.

* When you search for a specific chaos fault and the chaos manager cannot map this chaos fault to a chaos fault icon, the user interface does not display any error. Instead, it silently skips the error logs. (Chaos-814)

* The expected resilience score does not change to `NaN` (not a number) when you override it. (Chaos-791)

* The resource-type field was previously not available. Now, it has been made available and you can use this field to abort a chaos experiment in the audit trail. (Chaos-714)

## Early access features

The Harness Chaos Engineering (HCE) module, which you can use to perform chaos experiments on your applications and infrastructure, is now available for testing. To be part of this testing, contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io). HCE documentation, which includes user guides and [tutorials](https://developer.harness.io/tutorials/run-chaos-experiments), is available on the Harness Developer Hub. Harness recommends that you gain familiarity with the chaos experimentation workflow in HCE by following the instructions in [Your First Chaos Experiment Run](https://developer.harness.io/tutorials/run-chaos-experiments/first-chaos-engineering).

### Known issues

#### ChaosHub

* Github is the only Git provider for chaoshubs.
* Details for an already connected chaoshub cannot be updated.

#### Chaos infrastructure

* Chaos infrastructure cannot be installed through Harness Delegate.
* Logs for chaos infrastructure cannot be viewed.
* The properties of chaos infrastructure cannot be updated. You will need to provide blacklisted namespaces.
* The properties of the environment to which the chaos infrastructure belongs cannot be updated.
* Configuring chaos infrastructure does not provide support for Linux and Windows.
 
#### Chaos experiments

* Experiments with parallel faults cannot be created.
* Probe tunables cannot be updated or edited.
* A cron or recurring chaos experiment cannot be suspended or resumed.
* An individual fault in an experiment cannot be stopped through your input.
* A chaos experiment cannot be pushed to Gitlab, Bitbucket, or Gerrit.
* A chaos experiment cannot be pushed from Azure to Got
* SCM experiment push logs cannot be audited.

#### CI pipeline integration

* Optional assertion for chaos step failure cannot be provided during pipeline integration.
* The chaos error type(s) cannot be selected in a failure strategy.
* Timeouts cannot be defined for experiment execution.
* Access control cannot be gained for the chaos step addition.
* Pipeline template support cannot be obtained with the chaos steps.
* The experiment execution cannot be viewed from step output during the experiment run.
* Propagation cannot be aborted from chaos step to experiment execution.
* Information about propagation cannot be gained from pipeline to experiment (for audit purposes).
